        <li>
          <p><span id="date">1953</span> - Crosses ashort, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provides 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p>

Argues that fenetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "We've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p>
